Please make a new folder called "Manuscript_Code" and download the following files into the folder.
A) “Chemogenetic_inactivation_experiments_behavioral_random_intercepts_model_code.R” is the R code file used to produce the plots in Figure 5. The code is annotated with instructions. B) “CDMBT_MASTER_DATA_FRAME” is a csv needed for running the code in A, and containing all of the chemogenetic inactivation data. C) “Kainic_acid_lesion_experiments_spatial_histology_random_intercepts_code.R” is an R code file to produce the plots in Figure 7. The code is annotated with instructions. D) KAMBT_SPATIAL-HISTOLOGY_BEHAVIOR-DATA” is a csv needed for running the code in C, and containing all of the kainic acid lesion data. E) “lmer_cdmbt_r_table_output” is an output file you will duplicate while running the code provided in A. F) “KAMBT_LMER_TABLE” is an output file you will duplicate while running the code provided in C. G) The code is written to download the output plots into an empty subfolder of "Manuscript_Code" called "Plots". If for any reason the plots fail to save, please make an empty subfolder entitled "Plots" and try again.

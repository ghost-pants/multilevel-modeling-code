Extended Figure 5-2. Text file with link to downloadable folder of code for data availability for the multilevel models in Figures 5 and 7.
Link: https://github.com/ghost-pants/multilevel-modeling-code
Please make a new folder called "Manuscript_Code" and download the following files into the folder.
A) “Chemogenetic_inactivation_experiments_behavioral_random_intercepts_model_code.R” is the R code file used to produce the plots in Figure 5. The code is annotated. B) “CDMBT_MASTER_DATA_FRAME” is a csv needed for running the code in A. C) “Kainic_acid_lesion_experiments_spatial_histology_random_intercepts_code.R” is an R code file to produce the plots in Figure 7. The code is annotated. D) KAMBT_SPATIAL-HISTOLOGY_BEHAVIOR-DATA” is a csv needed for running the code in C. E) “lmer_cdmbt_r_table_output” is an output file you will duplicate while running the code provided in A. F) “KAMBT_LMER_TABLE” is an output file you will duplicate while running the code provided in C. G) The empty folder “Plots” is where the plots generated in the code in both A and C will be saved. If this downloaded folder did not include an empty “Plots” subfolder, please make one. H) “readme.txt” file includes these directions.
